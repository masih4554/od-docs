Open Dollar NFT Vaults (NFVs) are a new primitive in DeFi and a unique feature of the Open Dollar protocol.

On Open Dollar, vaults are represented as NFTs, making each vault distinct and transferable. This feature marks a significant evolution from traditional CDPs. Unlike traditional CDPs, where ownership is tied to an account, Open Dollar uses NFVs, which associate ownership of the collateral and debt to NFTs.

## Features

* ERC-721 standard: NFVs are compatible with all blockchain wallets and NFT marketplaces that support ERC-721.
Dynamic display images and metadata: NFV images show the current status, health, collateral, and debt of the vault with time-stamped updates, and are rendered entirely on-chain.
Direct wallet management: Users can directly manage and track their CDPs from their wallets, bypassing the need for interacting with the protocol's front end.
Composability and cross-chain capability: Facilitates easy batch-transfers and asset ownership transfers, along with efficient cross-chain compatibility.
Enhanced visibility and tracking: Integrates with wallet aggregators and portfolio trackers for dynamic pricing and updated insights.

## Benefits

Transferability and liquidity: NFVs make CDPs transferable and liquid, allowing trading in the open market.
Capital efficiency and accessibility: NFVs offer a capital-efficient solution, automating the selling of vaults to avoid liquidation penalties.
Improved treasury and risk management: Contributes to enhanced treasury management, risk assessment, and performance tracking.
Security benefits: Integrates into compliance and escrow services for enhanced protection against bad actors.
